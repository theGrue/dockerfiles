usage: code [options...] <file>

This program disassembles script, heap and logic resources.

<file> is the name of the resource you want to process (i.e. script.000).
Required.


Options:

-i <path>
	Sets the input directory to look for necessary files while processing
	script and heap resources. This usually includes other scripts, heaps,
	vocabs and sierra.exe file. The default is the current directory.

-o <path>
	Sets the output directory for extracted resource components. The
	default is the current directory.

-vs <0|1|2|3> (SCI), or
-vs <1|22|244|321> (AGI)
	Sets the script/logic version. The default is unknown, the program will
	try to detect it automatically.

-vo <1|2|24>
	Sets the AGI object version. The default is unknown, the program will
	try to detect it automatically.

-vw <1|2>
	Sets the AGI words.tok version. The default is unknown, the program will
	try to detect it automatically.

-vi <x.yyy.zzz>
	Sets the interpreter version and attempts to set all other at once,
	although some adjustment may be needed. The version info string may
	look like '0.000.409', 'T.A00.169', '1.cfs.058', '2.100.002', etc.
	AGI versions must be entered in a form of '1.0', '2.440', '3.002.086',
	etc. Usually it makes sense to look at the .exe/.ovl file first to get
	the proper value. Case sensitive. Optional.

-vd <0|1>
	Enables (1) or disables (0) the automatic version detection algorithm.
	If enabled, the version values above are used as hints only and may
	change during the processing. The default value is 1.

-?	Prints this screen.
