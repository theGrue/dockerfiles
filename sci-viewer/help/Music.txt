usage: music [options...] <file>

This program extracts information from sound and patch resources.

For patches it extracts "initialization" and "shutdown" SysEx sequences into
individual MIDI files.

For sounds the program saves individual tracks as MIDI files. Please note that
these tracks are not processed and most likely will sound incorrectly during
playback. Use -p option to save a "processed" version of specified tracks.
Digital samples (if any) will be saved as a separate .wav files.

<file> is the name of the resource you want to process (i.e. 123.snd).
Required.


Options:

-o <path>
	Sets the output directory for extracted resource components. The
	default is the current directory.

-p <track>[-<patch>][,...]
	Saves the "processed" version of specified tracks in addition to the
	raw one. Separate multiple tracks with a comma. The patch argument is
	optional (but highly recommended). For example, if you specify this
	option as "7-4.pat,12-1.pat,18" the program will save three additional
	tracks. Track 7 will be processed in according to the rules specified
	in the patch 4; track 12 using patch 1 and track 18 using internal
	rules. Optional.

-init
	Adds an initialization sequence (if any) from the specified patch in
	the beginning of "processed" tracks. Optional.

-vol <volume>
	Sets the volume (0-15) for "processed" tracks. This option has an
	effect only if the specified patch supports it. The default is 12.

-vs <0|1> (SCI)
-vs <1|2> (AGI)
	Sets the sound version. The default is unknown, the program will try
	to detect it automatically.

-vi <x.yyy.zzz>
	Sets the interpreter version and attempts to set all other at once,
	although some adjustment may be needed. The version info string may
	look like '0.000.409', 'T.A00.169', '1.cfs.058', '2.100.002', etc.
	AGI versions must be entered in a form of '1.0', '2.440', '3.002.086',
	etc. Usually it makes sense to look at the .exe/.ovl file first to get
	the proper value. Case sensitive. Optional.

-vd <0|1>
	Enables (1) or disables (0) the automatic version detection algorithm.
	If enabled, the version values above are used as hints only and may
	change during the processing. The default value is 1.

-ds <delay>
	The delay after each System Exclusive MIDI message, in 1/60s seconds.
	The default is 8.

-db <delay>
	The delay at the beginning of "processed" sound tracks just after the
	initialization sequence, in 1/60s seconds. The default is 15.

-de <delay>
	The delay at the end of "processed" sound tracks just before the
	shutdown sequence, in 1/60s seconds. The default is 30.
