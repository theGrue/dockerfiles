usage: vocab [options...] <file>

This program displays the specified vocab resource in XML format.

<file> is the name of the vocab resource file. Required.


Options:

-vo <1|2|24>
	Sets the AGI object version. The default is unknown, the program will
	try to detect it automatically.

-vw <1|2>
	Sets the AGI words.tok version. The default is unknown, the program will
	try to detect it automatically.

-vi <x.yyy.zzz>
	Sets the interpreter version and attempts to set all other at once,
	although some adjustment may be needed. AGI versions must be entered
	in a form of '1.0', '2.440', '3.002.086', etc. Usually it makes sense
	to look at the .ovl file first to get the proper value. Case
	sensitive. Optional.

-vd <0|1>
	Enables (1) or disables (0) the automatic version detection algorithm.
	If enabled, the version values above are used as hints only and may
	change during the processing. The default value is 1.

-?	Prints this screen.
