usage: graphics [options...] <file>

This program works with view, picture, cursor, palette and CLUT resources.

For views it saves all cels as individual .bmp files. For example, the first
cel of the first loop of the 123.v56 view will be saved as View123-0-0.bmp.
Keep in mind that some views that do not have an embedded palette will not be
displayed correctly. Use -pal option to specify the palette to use in this
case. The output displays the view metadata information in XML format.

For pictures the program saves embedded cels (if any) and displays metadata
information in XML format. Please note that some of pictures may not have
embedded cels at all. If you want pictures to be exported exactly as seen be
sure to use -v (and probably -pal) options.

Cursor images are saved as a 16-color bitmap.

Palettes and CLUT resources are displayed in XML format.

<file> is the name of the resource you want to process (i.e. view.000).
Required.


Options:

-o <path>
	Sets the output directory for extracted resource components. The
	default is the current directory.

-l
	Saves each loop in the view as an animated .gif file. Optional.

-v
	Saves the "visual" bitmap for picture resources. You may want to
	specify this option for all picture resources to see the bitmap as it
	appears on the screen. Optional.

-a <range>
	Saves the "visual" bitmap for picture resources as an animated .gif
	file. Use the <range> argument to specify one or more color ranges for
	palette animation, separated by a comma, i.e. "159-128,191-160".
	Works with 256-color pictures only. Optional.

-p
	Saves the "priority" bitmap for picture resources. Optional.

-c
	Saves the "control" bitmap for picture resources. Optional.

-pal <palette>
	Specifies the internal palette number for 16-color resources, or
	a name of the external palette file for 256-color resources. Supported
	files include *.pal (views/pics) and *.p56 (views only). Optional.

-vg <0|1|11|2|3>
	Sets the graphics version. The default is unknown, the program will
	try to detect it automatically.

-vi <x.yyy.zzz>
	Sets the interpreter version and attempts to set all other at once,
	although some adjustment may be needed. The version info string may
	look like '0.000.409', 'T.A00.169', '1.cfs.058', '2.100.002', etc.
	Usually it makes sense to look at the .exe file first to get the proper
	value. Case sensitive. Optional.

-vd <0|1>
	Enables (1) or disables (0) the automatic version detection algorithm.
	If enabled, the version values above are used as hints only and may
	change during the processing. The default value is 1.

-rle <0|1>
	Enables (1) or disables (0) the RLE compression for .bmp files. The
	default value is 1.

-fps <rate>
	Sets the frame rate for .gif files, 1-20 frames per second. The
	default value is 10.

-?	Prints this screen.
