usage: resource [options...] <file>

This program extracts individual resources from resource archives.

<file> is the name of the archive you want to process (i.e. resource.000).
Supported types include normal and audio resource packs, as well as chunks.
You may also specify a drive name (i.e. d:\) to extract AGI volumes or SCI
CD-Audio resources. In the last case you need to be sure that cdaudio.map
file is available. Required.


Options:

-i <path>
	Sets the input directory to look for .map files when extracting
	resources from the .aud/.sfx archives. The default is the current
	directory.

-o <path>
	Sets the output directory for extracted resource files. The default is
	the current directory.

-r <0|1|2>
	Controls the program behavior when the extracted resource already
	exists in the output directory. When this parameter is 0, the
	file will be skipped. 1 means overwrite the existing resource with the
	new one. When this option is set to 2, a new version of the resource
	will be created with ;nnn appended to the file name. The default is 0.

-vr <0|1|1L|11|2|21|3>
	Sets the version of the resource pack. The default is unknown, i.e.
	the program will try to detect it automatically.

-vn <0|1>
	Sets the resource naming convention. 0 means 'type.id', i.e.
	'view.123'. 1 means 'id.typ', i.e. '123.v56'. The default is unknown,
	the program will try to detect it automatically.

-vb <1|2>
	Sets the base36 resource naming convention. 1 means '@*.*' for audio36
	resources and '#*.*' for sync36 resources. 2 means 'a*.*' and 's*.*',
	respectively. The default is unknown, the program will try to detect it
	automatically.

-vg <0|1|11|2|3>
	Sets the graphics version. Needed to properly write the individual
	resource headers for graphics files (pictures, views, palettes). The
	default is unknown, program will try to detect it automatically.

-vs <0|1|1|2|3>
	Sets the script version. Needed to properly write the individual
	resource headers for script files (scripts, heaps). The default is
	unknown, program will try to detect it automatically.

-vm <11|1C>
	Sets the version of map resources. The default is unknown, the program
	will try to detect it automatically.

-vi <x.yyy.zzz>
	Sets the interpreter version and attempts to set all other at once,
	although some adjustment may be needed. The version info string may
	look like '0.000.409', 'T.A00.169', '1.cfs.058', '2.100.002', etc.
	AGI versions must be entered in a form of '2.440', '3.002.086', etc.
	Usually it makes sense to look at the .exe file first to get the proper
	value. Case sensitive. Optional.

-vd <0|1>
	Enables (1) or disables (0) the automatic version detection algorithm.
	If enabled, the version values above are used as hints only and may
	change during the processing. The default value is 1.

-cda <offset>
	Specifies the CDAudio track offset relatively to it's position in the
	TOC, in sectors (75 per second). You may need to adjust it when ripped
	resources are slightly off their normal position. The default value is
	-114 and should be correct for the 'Jones in the fast lane' (seems to
	be the only game with these resources so far).

-?	Prints this screen.
