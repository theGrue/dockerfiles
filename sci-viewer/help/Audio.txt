usage: audio [options...] <file>

This program works with audio and CD-audio resources.

<file> is the name of the resource you want to process (i.e. 123.aud).
Required.


Options:

-o <path>
	Sets the output directory for extracted resource components. The
	default is the current directory.

-va <1|11|1C|2>
	Sets the audio version. The default is unknown, the program will
	try to detect it automatically.

-vi <x.yyy.zzz>
	Sets the interpreter version and attempts to set all other at once,
	although some adjustment may be needed. The version info string may
	look like '0.000.409', 'T.A00.169', '1.cfs.058', '2.100.002', etc.
	Usually it makes sense to look at the .exe file first to get the proper
	value. Case sensitive. Optional.

-vd <0|1>
	Enables (1) or disables (0) the automatic version detection algorithm.
	If enabled, the version values above are used as hints only and may
	change during the processing. The default value is 1.

-?	Prints this screen.
